## 💡 Core Features & Innovations

### 1. Interactive 3D Blockchain Protocol Labs
- **Live Cryptographic Hashing**: Visual playground using browser-native `crypto.subtle` SHA-256 hashing. Watch hashes update instantly character-by-character.
- **Blockchain Linkage & Tamper Simulator**: Chain 3 sequential blocks together. Mutate Block #1 and observe the cryptographic chain break in real-time as subsequent block hashes become invalid.
- **Asymmetric Cryptography Lab**: Generate public/private key pairs and digitally sign transactions to understand how non-custodial ownership works.

### 2. Guided 15-Lesson Dual-Mode Curriculum
- Dual explanations: **Simple (Plain English)** for newcomers and **Technical (Protocol Specs)** for developers.
- Knowledge check quizzes with instant grading, XP rewards, and level progression.
- Personal study notes synchronized per lesson.

### 3. Market Discovery with Plain-English Translations
- **Anti-Unit-Bias Guidance**: Explains why token price alone does not reflect true valuation, emphasizing Market Capitalization.
- **Simple vs. Advanced Toggle**: View plain-English fundamentals or flip to technical volume, high/low spread, and consensus metrics.

### 4. Risk-Free $100,000 Paper Trading Simulator
- Execute simulated **BUY** and **SELL** orders with live portfolio balance and holdings valuation.

## 🏛️ Tech Stack

CryptoVerse is built using a lightweight, native web stack with no complex build steps required:

- **Frontend**: HTML5, Vanilla CSS, Vanilla JavaScript. We utilize **Three.js** for engaging 3D scenes and **IntersectionObserver** APIs for smooth, high-performance scroll reveal animations. **Lucide Icons** are used for modern, scalable iconography.
- **Backend**: **PHP 8.0+**
- **Database**: **MySQL 8.0+**
- **Server Environment**: Designed optimally for **WAMP Server** (Windows), but fully compatible with LAMP or XAMPP stacks.

## 🚀 Quick Start & WAMP Server Deployment

Follow these instructions to get CryptoVerse running locally using WAMP server.

### 1. WAMP Installation & Setup
1. Download and install [WampServer](https://www.wampserver.com/en/).
2. Start WampServer. **Crucial:** Wait until the WAMP tray icon in your Windows taskbar turns **GREEN**. This indicates that both the Apache web server and the MySQL database server are running successfully. If it is orange or red, check for port conflicts (e.g., Skype or IIS using port 80).
3. Copy the entire `cryptoverse` project folder into your WAMP web root directory:
   - `C:\wamp64\www\cryptoverse`

### 2. Database Setup via phpMyAdmin
1. Open your browser and navigate to the WAMP phpMyAdmin interface:
   - `http://localhost/phpmyadmin`
2. Log in. (The default WAMP username is `root` with **no password**).
3. In the left sidebar or the "Databases" tab, create a new database named **`cryptoverse`** with the collation `utf8mb4_unicode_ci`.
4. Select the newly created `cryptoverse` database.
5. Click on the **Import** tab at the top.
6. Click **Choose File** and select the `database/schema.sql` file located in your `cryptoverse` project folder.
7. Click **Go** at the bottom of the page to run the import. This will build all the required tables and insert the seed data (lessons, quizzes, and demo accounts).

### 3. Launching the App
1. Once the database is imported, verify the database credentials in `config/database.php` (if you are using the default WAMP setup, no changes are needed).
2. Open your browser and navigate to:
   - `http://localhost/cryptoverse/`
3. You should see the CryptoVerse landing page!

## 🛡️ Security & Best Practices
- **Prepared Statements**: All database operations in PHP utilize PDO parameterized queries, preventing SQL injection.
- **Session Protection**: Sessions regenerate session IDs upon login to prevent session fixation.
- **Atomic Financial Transactions**: Trade executions utilize `PDO::beginTransaction()` and `commit()` to guarantee that cash deductions and asset quantities are updated atomically.
